First of all, you need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create it [here](https://github.com).

To create a post, you need to fork the repository [gironajs](https://github.com/gironajs/gironajs.com):

![Fork](/assets/blog/publica-un-post-a-gironajs/github-fork.png)

Once the fork is done, if you are the first one, we will automatically add ourselves as authors. To do this, we need to edit the file **_config/member.ts_** and add our GitHub username and, if desired, some details:

```ts:config/member.ts
const members: Member[] = [
  ...
  {
    github: 'eudago',
    name: 'Eudald Dachs',
    role: 'Senior Software Development Engineer',
    company: 'Kave Home',
    linkedin: 'eudald-dachs',
  }
  ...
];
```

After adding ourselves as authors, all we need to do is create a new file in the folder **_blog/ca/[slug-del-post]_**.

For example, if we want to create a post with the title "Publish a blog post on GironaJS," the slug will be "publish-a-post-on-gironajs".

This file should have the following format:

```markdown:blog/en/publish-a-post-on-gironajs.mdx

Post content
```

We can distinguish two parts in this file: the metadata and the post content.

The metadata is part of the post content. For example, the post title, description, cover image, author, etc.

It is important to add all the metadata fields as they are used to display the post.

Next, we will explain how we can create the content of the post using Markdown and MDX.

Once we have created the post content and made a commit and push to our repository (fork), we can proceed to create a pull request to the original repository.

### Using Markdown and MDX for the post content

The post content can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

To add an image, you can do it as follows:

```markdown
![GironaJS Image](/assets/blog/gironajs-the-catalan-javascript-community/cover-image.jpg)
```

To add a link, you can use the following format:

```markdown
[Link to GironaJS](https://gironajs.org)
```

To add a code block, you can use the following format:

````markdown
```js
const foo = 'bar';
```
````

You can also add React components. The React components are located in the **_components/mdx/_** folder and need to be imported in the **_components/index.ts_** file.

Once the component is imported, you can use it in your post.

For example, if you want to add the **_Counter_** component to your post, you can do it as follows:

```jsx
<Counter />
```

Here's an example of a counter:

<Counter />

This allows us to add React components to our post.

You can find more information on the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) website.
