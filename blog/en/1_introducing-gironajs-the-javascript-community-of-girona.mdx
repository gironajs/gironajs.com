## Introduction

GironaJS is a community of Catalan JavaScript developers. Our main goal is to create a space for gathering and networking to share experiences and knowledge.

To achieve this goal, GironaJS organizes monthly talks, JavaScript workshops, and maintains a blog in Catalan. We also have a Discord channel where everyone is welcome to contribute their opinions.

We aim to become the leading Catalan portal for JavaScript in Catalonia! Join us and be part of this community!

### Why is now the right time?

In recent years, the development sector in Girona has experienced substantial growth. This is due to the choice of Girona by many technology companies to establish their presence. Girona is an exceptional city to live in, with an inspiring environment and a high quality of life.

We firmly believe that there is untapped potential in the JavaScript ecosystem in Girona.

## What We Do?

### ✏️ JavaScript Blog in Catalan

At GironaJS, we maintain a blog in Catalan and English, covering various topics related to the JavaScript ecosystem. All members are welcome to contribute, and we also invite non-members to submit JavaScript blogs in Catalan.

> Blogs are an essential part of preserving and sharing knowledge. Feel free to publish your blog on GironaJS! It's as easy as submitting a pull request to the GironaJS website with your article.

You can find the current blogs on the [blog page](https://gironajs.com/ca/blog).

### 👥 Discord Channel

GironaJS has a Discord channel for discussing technical questions on any JavaScript-related topics. We also have channels to facilitate communication and networking in other areas. If you're interested in joining our Discord community, click [here](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax)!

### 💬 Monthly Talks

One of our main goals is to foster networking within the JavaScript community in Girona. Therefore, we aim to organize at least one talk per month! We encourage you to propose a talk on a new technology, a complex solution implemented in your company, or any other topic you find suitable. If you're interested in proposing a talk, join our Discord server and share it in the #xerrades channel.

> The monthly talks will be sponsored by a sponsor. This allows us to offer high-quality talks and ensure the sustainability of GironaJS as a community.

### 🔨 Workshops

We are open to organizing workshops related to JavaScript based on the community's demand. Although workshops will be less frequent than the monthly talks, they are an engaging activity for hands-on experience with unfamiliar technologies. We will propose workshops based on the needs and interests of the participants.

### ✨ Open Source

At GironaJS, we encourage collaboration on open-source projects with the community, such as our website, GironaJS. If you have any ideas for an open-source project that the community can work on, join our Discord server and share them in the #open-source channel.
