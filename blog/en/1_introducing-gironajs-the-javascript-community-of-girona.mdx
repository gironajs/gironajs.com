GironaJS is a Catalan JavaScript community. Its main objective is to create a meeting and networking space to share experiences and knowledge.

To achieve this, at GironaJS we hold monthly talks, JavaScript workshops and maintain a blog written in Catalan. We also have a Discord channel where everyone is welcome to contribute.

We want to be the main Catalan JavaScript portal in Catalonia. Join us and be part of this community!

#### Why now?

Girona is an exceptional city to live in with an inspiring environment and a high life quality.

Durint the last years, the development sector in Girona has experienced a substantial growth due to remote working and the strong commitment by companies in the area to their digitization trying to keep talent here.

We strongly believe that Girona's JavaScript ecosystem has a high unexplored potential with a clear lack of connection between developers, companies and organizations. GironaJS tries to fill the gap between all parts, generating an ecosystem where everyone can have their place while encouraging the use of Catalan.

### What are we offering?

As a starting point, we have launched a set of initiatives in order to cover the different needs that may exist. Everyone is welcome to participate as well as propose new ones.

#### 1. Blog in Catalan

At GironaJS we maintain a blog in Catalan and English about everything related to the JavaScript ecosystem. Everyone is welcome to contribute regardless of the topic, as long as it's related to the JavaScript ecosystem.

> Blogs are an essential part of sharing knowledge. We encourage you to publish your blog post in GironaJS! It's as easy as making a Pull Request on the GironaJS website with your content.

You can find the current blogs on the [blog](https://gironajs.com/ca/blog) page.

#### 2. Discord channel

There is a Discord channel to discuss any JavaScript related topic.

This channel is open to anyone interested in JavaScript development, whether you're just starting out or have been in the industry for 20 years.

For juniors, it's an ideal place to get answers to questions from more experienced people, while for more senior people, it's a perfect space to share and discuss issues and new technologies. There is always room to learn new things!

The channel audience target are JavaScript developers. However, we also have channels to promote communication and networking in other areas. Everything related to job offers is forbidden.

> Don't wait more! Join the Discord now by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax)!

#### 3. Monthly talks

One of our main goals is to promote networking inside the Girona JavaScript ecosystem.

For this reason, we propose to hold at least one talk a month! We encourage you to propose a talk about a new technology, a complex solution carried out in your company or any other topic you consider appropriate.

If wanted, a new blog article can be written for each talk, sharing the knowledge and giving visibility to the writter.

If you are determined to propose a topic, go to [Discord](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax) and comment in the #xerrades channel.

> The monthly talks will be sponsored. Thanks to sponsors, we will be able to offer higher quality talks while making GironaJS a sustainable community.

#### 4. Workshops

We are open to organize JavaScript related workshops based on community suggestions.

Although the workshops will be less frequent than the monthly talks, they are a very interesting activity to get deeper into many topics. We will suggest workshops according to the community needs and interests.

#### 5. Open source

At GironaJS we push for being Open Source. One example is our website gironajs.com. If you have an idea for an open source project that could be carried out by the community, please join our Discord server and share it in the #open-source channel.

### About us

The community has been altruistically started by a group of developers from Girona but we want everyone to contribute.

We want to thank everyone who has participated in organizing the community, preparing the talks, writting the blog, etc:

#### How to be part of GironaJS?

All you have to do is join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax) and introduce yourself!

Introducing yourself is mandatory, as this way we can validate one by one the people who become part of GironaJS, maintaining a healthy and controlled community.

### Location

GironaJS is a remotely distributed community, and therefore the best place to find us is on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax).

However, our meetings, talks and workshops will mostly take place at one of our sponsors, specifically at [GironaHub](https://girona-hub.com/).

### Sponsors

To ensure the sustainability of the community, we are looking for sponsors for our events such as talks and workshops.

During the event, the sponsor will have 10 minutes to promote itself. Also, all sponsors will be mentioned on our website in the future.

TODO!! We should have some kind of contact, an email or something. It should be managed more privately I think.

> If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, we recommend you join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/eBkQTD2Pax) and send a message to the #general channel, which is open to everyone.

### Final thoughts

We believe that Girona has great talent and potential that often is unnoticed. With this conviction, we have created GironaJS aiming to merge this talent, increasing networking and sharing everyone's knowledge.

If you are interested in JavaScript, whether you are from Girona or not, we encourage you to join as a member of GironaJS. We await you with open arms! ðŸ˜Š
